# Overview

POM Manipulation Extension (PME) is a Maven tool to align the versions in your POMs according to some external reference, sort of like a BOM but much more extensive and without the added baggage of a BOM declaration.

It is suppplied as a core library, a Maven extension (in the sense of installing to `lib/ext`, not `pom.xml` `<extensions/>`) and a command line tool.

This extension combines many of the features of [VMan](https://github.com/jdcasey/pom-version-manipulator), [Maven Versioning Extension](https://github.com/jdcasey/maven-versioning-extension) and [Maven Dependency Management Extension](https://github.com/jboss/maven-dependency-management-extension).

For more details on usage see https://release-engineering.github.io/pom-manipulation-ext.
